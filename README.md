# Stationary Wave Detection and Localization
This repository contains the code for our paper, titled "Detection and Localization of Stationary Waves on Venus Using a Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection Model".

## System Requirements and Setup
We run our experiments in Ubuntu 20.04 using Nvidia A100 GPU.
To set up and use the required environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n venus_waves python=3.9

2. **Activate the environment:**
